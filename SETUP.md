# Environment Setup

## Conda Environment Created Successfully ✅

### Environment Details
- **Name**: `agi`
- **Python Version**: 3.11.13
- **Location**: `/opt/homebrew/anaconda3/envs/agi`

### Installed Dependencies
- **langgraph**: 0.4.8 (LangGraph framework)
- **langchain**: 0.3.25 (LangChain core)
- **langchain-core**: 0.3.65 (LangChain core components)
- **pydantic**: 2.11.7 (Data validation)

## Usage Commands

### Activate Environment
```bash
conda activate agi
```

### Run Comprehensive Tests
```bash
python test_agent.py
```

### Run Interactive Demo
```bash
python test_agent.py interactive
```

### Run Custom Scripts
```bash
python cognitive_agent.py
```

## Test Results Summary ✅

The cognitive architecture successfully demonstrates:

1. **Memory Systems**: All 7 memory types working (sensory, perceptual, spatial, episodic, declarative, procedural, sensory-motor)
2. **Consciousness Layer**: Global workspace competition with coalitions
3. **Learning Pathways**: Cross-system learning (episodic→declarative, procedural learning from consciousness)
4. **Motor Systems**: Action selection and execution with behavioral schemes
5. **LangGraph Integration**: Complete cognitive cycle orchestration

### Performance Metrics from Test Run:
- **Memory Contents**: Up to 15 perceptual contents, 5 episodes processed
- **Learning Events**: 10 episodic learning events, 5 procedural learning events
- **Action Execution**: 4 completed motor plans, 0 failures
- **Consciousness**: Consistent conscious content generation with coherence scores 0.99+

## Architecture Validation ✅

The prototype successfully implements the cognitive architecture specified in AGENT.MD:
- ✅ All memory systems operational
- ✅ Global workspace theory implementation
- ✅ Attention and structure building codelets
- ✅ Learning pathways between memory systems
- ✅ Motor plan execution and feedback loops
- ✅ Complete cognitive cycle with LangGraph orchestration

Ready for further development and experimentation!
