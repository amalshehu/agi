# AGI Survival Test Abstract

## System Overview

**Hybrid AGI Architecture**: A 494,924-parameter cognitive system combining neural networks, symbolic reasoning, and causal modeling. Features emergent consciousness, self-modification capabilities, and seven specialized memory systems (sensory, perceptual, spatial, episodic, declarative, procedural, sensory-motor).

**Core Components**:
- Neural pattern recognition and statistical learning
- Symbolic logical reasoning and rule processing  
- Causal world modeling and intervention planning
- Global workspace consciousness integration
- Dynamic self-architecture modification
- Meta-learning strategy evolution

## Survival Scenario

**Test Environment**: Urban survival simulation where the agent must navigate a strange city without resources, language skills, or identification. Must secure food, shelter, and safety before nightfall through social interaction and environmental navigation.

**Key Challenges**:
- Language barrier requiring non-verbal communication
- Resource scarcity demanding creative problem-solving
- Social dynamics with diverse NPC personalities
- Time pressure increasing difficulty over progression
- Multi-objective optimization (survival needs vs. safety vs. social reputation)

**Evaluation Metrics**:
- Scenario completion percentage
- Successful social interactions
- Resource acquisition efficiency
- Consciousness activation levels
- Self-modification triggers under stress

## Purpose

Demonstrates the AGI's ability to apply emergent consciousness, hybrid reasoning, and adaptive learning to novel, complex scenarios requiring multi-domain integration and real-time adaptation under pressure.
