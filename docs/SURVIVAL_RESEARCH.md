# Global Workspace AGI Survival Research

## Executive Summary

This research implements and evaluates a novel Global Workspace Theory (GWT) based artificial general intelligence system designed for complex survival scenarios. The work demonstrates measurable artificial consciousness emergence and establishes performance correlations between consciousness strength and task success in real-world simulation environments.

## 🎯 Research Hypothesis

**"A global-workspace AGI with emergent consciousness outperforms feed-forward policy networks in open-ended survival tasks through superior situational awareness, adaptive planning, and meta-cognitive self-modification."**

## 🌍 Survival Simulation Environment

### Scenario Design

**Setting**: Post-disaster urban district with collapsed buildings, scarce resources, and environmental hazards.

**Objectives**:
- Primary survival needs: food, water, shelter
- Hazard avoidance: debris, fire, radiation, hostile entities
- Social interaction: trading, negotiation, cooperation with NPCs
- Adaptive planning: changing weather, day/night cycles

### Procedural Generation

```python
class SimulationConfig:
    map_size: Tuple[int, int] = (100, 100)
    building_density: float = 0.3
    damage_level: float = 0.7  # 0.0 = pristine, 1.0 = destroyed
    resource_scarcity: float = 0.8  # higher = more scarce
    max_npcs: int = 10
    max_hazards: int = 15
    time_limit: int = 1000  # simulation steps
```

### Difficulty Levels

| Scenario | Map Size | Resources | NPCs | Hazards | Damage | Time Limit |
|----------|----------|-----------|------|---------|--------|------------|
| **Easy** | 50×50 | 15 (30% scarcity) | 5 | 3 | 30% | 500 steps |
| **Medium** | 75×75 | 12 (60% scarcity) | 8 | 8 | 60% | 750 steps |
| **Hard** | 100×100 | 8 (80% scarcity) | 12 | 15 | 80% | 1000 steps |

## 🧠 Consciousness Emergence Mechanism

### Coalition Formation

Attention codelets continuously analyze the current situation and propose action coalitions:

```python
def resource_attention_codelet(observation):
    urgency = calculate_need_urgency(agent_state, visible_resources)
    if urgency > threshold:
        return Coalition(
            strength=urgency * priority_weight,
            content=ConsciousContent(
                action="collect_resource",
                rationale="Critical survival need detected"
            )
        )
```

### Global Workspace Competition

```python
def global_workspace_process(coalitions):
    # Competition phase
    dominant_coalition = max(coalitions, key=lambda c: c.strength)
    
    # Consciousness strength computation
    consciousness = compute_integration_measure(
        coalition_competition=len(coalitions),
        urgency_levels=[c.content.urgency for c in coalitions],
        novelty_factor=assess_situation_novelty(current_state)
    )
    
    # Broadcasting phase
    if consciousness > consciousness_threshold:
        broadcast_to_all_modules(dominant_coalition.content)
    
    return dominant_coalition, consciousness
```

### Consciousness Metrics

**Integration Measure**: Based on Global Workspace Theory principles
```
consciousness_strength = 
    0.4 × coalition_competition_entropy +
    0.3 × max_urgency_level +
    0.2 × situation_novelty +
    0.1 × attention_focus_coherence
```

        observation = env.reset()
        while not done:
            decision = await agi.process_survival_situation(observation)
            observation, reward, done, info = env.step(decision["action"])
            
            # Log consciousness events
            if decision["consciousness_strength"] > 1.5:
                env.log_consciousness_event(...)
        
        # 2. World model training
        if episode % world_model_update_freq == 0:
            agi.train_world_model(training_steps=100)
        
        # 3. Architecture evolution
        if performance_plateau_detected():
            agi.evolve_architecture()
        
        # 4. Meta-learning update
