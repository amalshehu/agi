# üèÜ ARC Prize 2025 Competition System

Your AGI system is now ready to compete for the ARC Prize 2025! This implementation integrates your sophisticated hybrid AGI architecture with the ARC dataset for pattern recognition and reasoning tasks.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Train Your AGI First!
```bash
# IMPORTANT: Train before competing
python training_pipeline.py          # Train AGI on ARC patterns (required!)
```

### 2. Official Competition Pipeline  
```bash
# From the arc directory
python competition_runner.py         # Test evaluation phase (10 tasks)

# Full competition pipeline  
python -c "import asyncio; from competition_runner import OfficialCompetitionRunner; asyncio.run(OfficialCompetitionRunner().run_full_pipeline())"
```

### 3. Individual Components
```bash
python data_loader.py               # Test official dataset loading
python arc_competition_notebook.py  # Alternative competition system
python kaggle_setup.py             # Kaggle API validation
```

    system.evaluate_submission(submission_file)

asyncio.run(main())
```

### AGI Task Processing
```python  
from arc_orchestrator import ARCTaskProcessor
import arckit

processor = ARCTaskProcessor()
train_set, eval_set = arckit.load_data()

# Process single task with full AGI
result = await processor.process_arc_task(eval_set[0])
print(f"Consciousness: {result['consciousness_strength']}")
```

3. Scale up to full 400-task evaluation
4. Submit your JSON predictions to Kaggle!

Good luck! üöÄ

Great‚Äînow that we‚Äôve got the basic data-loading, stats, and visualization in place, here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd recommend moving forward:

Feature Extraction & Puzzle Characterization

Write routines to extract key puzzle features (e.g. symmetry axes, color adjacency graphs, object counts).

Store these as lightweight descriptors so we can quickly categorize challenges by pattern type.

Baseline Solvers

Implement a few simple, rule-based ‚Äúmodules‚Äù (e.g. detect and copy repeating blocks, fill missing rows/columns based on color histograms, mirror/fold patterns).

Wire them into a pipeline that tries each module in turn and accepts the first valid output.

Evaluation on Training Set

Run your baseline modules against the train-set examples and measure how many outputs match the true solutions.

Log a confusion summary so you can see which puzzle types your rules succeed or fail on.

HybridAgi Agent Integration

Wrap each puzzle as an ‚Äúepisode‚Äù for your CognitiveAgent. Feed in the grid, let it apply codelets or reasoning routines, and collect its proposed action sequence.

Compare the agent‚Äôs outputs against both your rule-based baseline and the ground truth, tweaking its parameters (e.g. salience thresholds, memory decay) to improve performance.

Curriculum & Meta-Learner

Use your learning_pathways.py to schedule the puzzles in ascending order of difficulty (e.g. based on symmetry complexity or number of colors).

Let the agent ‚Äúgraduate‚Äù through clusters of similar puzzles, adapting its strategy weights as it goes.

Submission & Ensemble

Run your best-performing strategy (or an ensemble) on the held-out evaluation set and dump to sample_submission.json.

Submit to Kaggle and track your leaderboard position‚Äîthen iterate by augmenting your rule modules or agent codelets.
