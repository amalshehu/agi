# 🧠 SOTA AGI Survivor

**Test-Time Compute Scaling • Multi-Agent Reasoning • Iterative Refinement**

A mind-blowing demonstration of state-of-the-art AGI capabilities without using transformers.

## 🚀 What Makes This SOTA?

### 1. Test-Time Compute Scaling (o1-style)
- **More thinking = Better decisions**
- Iterative reasoning with increasing compute budget
- Each reasoning pass improves decision quality
- Demonstrates the future of AI: spending compute on thinking, not just model size

### 2. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- **Specialized reasoning agents:**
  - 🆘 **Survival Agent**: Analyzes immediate needs (food, water, shelter)
  - 👥 **Social Agent**: Models human behavior and communication strategies  
  - 🗺️ **Navigation Agent**: Spatial reasoning and urban environment analysis
  - 📋 **Planning Agent**: Strategic sequencing and resource optimization
  - 🔍 **Critique Agent**: Self-evaluation and reasoning gap detection

### 3. Advanced World Simulation
- **Dynamic environment** with time-dependent changes
- **Complex NPCs** with personalities, motivations, and resources
- **Realistic interactions** based on social psychology
- **Emergent behaviors** from simple rule interactions

### 4. Self-Improving Architecture
- **Self-critique loops** identify reasoning gaps
- **Confidence tracking** guides decision making
- **Iterative refinement** improves outputs through multiple passes
- **Meta-reasoning** about the reasoning process itself

## 🎯 The Challenge: "Lost in a Strange City"

**Scenario**: Wake up in unfamiliar city with no phone, money, or language skills. Find food and shelter before nightfall.

**AGI Requirements**:
- Multi-perspective analysis
- Social intelligence without language
- Resource optimization under constraints
- Dynamic adaptation to changing situations
- Complex decision making under uncertainty
